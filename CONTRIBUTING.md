- Be respectful and inclusive

## üîÑ Development Workflow

We follow a standard GitHub flow for all contributions:

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/moneywiz-mcp-server.git
cd moneywiz-mcp-server
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jcvalerio/moneywiz-mcp-server.git
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Always branch from main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/update-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
```bash
# Set up development environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"

# Run setup
python setup_env.py

# Make your changes and test them
python -m pytest tests/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional commits format
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature description"
# or
git commit -m "fix: Fix issue description"
